    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3 class="ingredient">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>1 Cup mushroom mix (shitakes, creminis, morel)</li>
          <li>1 Cup Arborio rice</li>
          <li>1 litre Vegetable Stock</li>
          <li>1 lemon</li>
          <li>olive oil</li>
          <li>few tabs of butter</li>
          <li>freshly grated parmesean cheese</li>
          <li>chives or green onion</li>
          <li>2 small to medium shallots </li>
          <li>1 bottle of dry white wine</li>
      </ul>
    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Warm stock with lid until boiling and then turn off heat.</li>
          <li>Thinly slice mushrooms and then cook on medium heat with oil for 3 minutes until tender. Remove from heat with liquid.</li>
          <li>Dice up shallots and fry with a small amount of butter until softened.</li>
          <li>Add the rice to the shallots with some oil. Move around to coat rice and cook for a few minutes until it takes on a golden colour.</li>
          <li>Add 1/4 Cup wine to deglaze and stir rice to incorporate. Pour the rest of the wine into a glass and enjoy while you cook.</li>
          <li>Slice up lemon and squeeze juice, enduring that no seeds fall into rice.</li>
          <li>Begin by adding half a ladle of the stock and continuously stir the rice until all the liquid is incorporated.</li>
          <li>Repeat the process of adding the stock, slowly building up to a full ladle. Be sure that all the liquid is incorporated into the rice before adding more.</li>
          <li>After all the stock is abosrded, the rice should be soft and creamy. Add at least a tablespoon of butter (or more if preferred), salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>After seasoning properly, add mushroom with its liquid and stir into stock and remove from heat. Grate parmesean and stir into risotto.</li>
          <li>Serve in bowls and then chop up some chives and add right before serving.</li>
      </ol>
